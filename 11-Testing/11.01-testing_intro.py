# Testing
    # New features you implement may lead to more errors
    # So many people may have written code which may effect code you don't even know/think about 
    # We use TESTING to solve these bugs

    # We usually creare a test.py file that accompanies another module that it tests
    # Look at main and test.py

    # Use:
        # pylint
        # pyflakes
        # PEP.8

    # But these r just simple
