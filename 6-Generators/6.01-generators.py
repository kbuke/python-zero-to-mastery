# Generators
    # Allow us to generate a sequence of values over time, for example RANGE
    # They are iterables and marked by YIELD

        yield a # This gives the current value of a to the calling code
        temp = a + b # temporary sum

    # They don't store sequence in memory, and yield one value at a time.
    # It's useful if you don't need all results at once, if you want to stop midway, or are dealing with infinite or a large sequence.
