# Actions we can perform on numerical data sets, there are many in Python
# For now, focus on:
    # ** => the power of x
print(f"2 to the power of 2 is {2 ** 2}")

    # // => Round Down
print(f"Rounding down 5 / 4 is {5 // 4}")

    # % => Shows the remainder of a division
print(f"The remainder of 6 / 4 is {6 % 4}")

    # round => Rounds to nearest integer
print(f"The nearest integer to 3.1 is {round(3.1)}, and 3.6 is {round(3.6)}")

    # abs => Turns a negative number into a positive
print(f"To turn -20 to 20 we use abs so that -20 = {abs(-20)}")
